Real-time insight from virtual patient models.

Our digital twins replicate physiological and behavioral states in real time to power adaptive self-monitoring and remote patient management. These models transform passive data into actionable insight—supporting personalization, safety, and engagement.

<!--
Digital twins create a virtual replica of the human body's organ system of interest, using physiological and behavioral models to simulate complex interactions within the body’s systems.

The use of digital twins is threefold:

- Synthetic Data Generation
  - Create virtual populations to inform trial design
- Digital Biomarkers; Context of Use (COU)
  - Detect change in the degree or extent of the condition
  - Prognostic: e.g. Patient enrichment
  - Detect early signs of efficacy
  - Susceptibility: Indicyate risk of event for early interception
- Digital Therapeutics (DTx) Development
  - Model-Informed Mechanisms of Action (MOA)
  - Integrate as closed-loop feedback systems

Provide insights into treatment effects within specific physiological pathways

## The brain controls all 10 organ system

The brain coordinates all ten major organ systems, ensuring balance and function across the entire body, highlighting that Digital Therapeutics (DTx) extends far beyond mental health to support comprehensive bodily health.

## Kalman filter

The Kalman filter enhances these models by continuously refining predictions and adapting to new data, making digital twins precise and responsive.

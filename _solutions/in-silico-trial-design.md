We support the design and optimization of clinical trials for Digital Therapeutics and Digital Biomarkers through virtual patient modeling and in silico experimentation. Our simulations help refine inclusion criteria, predict outcomes, and reduce development risksâ€”accelerating time-to-market while supporting regulatory alignment.

From MoA to mechanism-based designâ€”AI-accelerated DTx discovery.

We apply _in silico_ modeling and rule-based AI to explore digital mechanisms of action. Our approach turns early concepts into testable hypotheses, mapping intervention targets, delivery paths, and expected outcomes. The result: better-designed interventions, grounded in science, ready for rapid feasibility testing.

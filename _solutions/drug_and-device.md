We help position Digital Therapeutics and Digital Biomarkers at the intersection of drugs, devices, and software. From aligning with PDURS frameworks in the U.S. to leveraging DiGA and upcoming Class IIb pathways in Europe, we guide your regulatory strategy to support smart medications and connected solutions.

<!--
With PDURS (prescription drug use-related software), the U.S. is taking the lead in Digital Therapeutics (DTx) adoption, setting benchmarks in regulatory oversight and innovation.

Germany’s DiGA program is pioneering regulated digital health solutions in Europe, offering a structured pathway that balances evidence, safety, and integration into healthcare systems—and is soon expanding to include Class IIb devices, a move that addresses previous limitations in developing smart medications.

With PDURS (prescription drug use-related software), the U.S. is taking the lead in Digital Therapeutics (DTx) adoption, setting benchmarks in regulatory oversight and innovation.

Germany’s DiGA program is pioneering regulated digital health solutions in Europe, offering a structured pathway that balances evidence, safety, and integration into healthcare systems—and is soon expanding to include Class IIb devices, a move that addresses previous limitations in developing smart medications.

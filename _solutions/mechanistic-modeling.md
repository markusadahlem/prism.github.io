We develop digital Mechanism-of-Action (MOA) models inspired by Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) to simulate the causal pathway between digital interventions and clinical outcomes. Our approach bridges behavioral, physiological, and computational domains, enabling _in silico_ testing of DTx and Digital Biomarkers before clinical deployment.

Bringing preclinical rigor to digital health—fast, explainable, and designed for differentiation and IP protection.

<!--Accelerate innovation in digital therapeutics and biomarkers with confidence.

The development of evidence-based digital health solutions—from remote monitoring to closed-loop interventions—demands scientific rigor, speed, and regulatory clarity. PRISMA delivers model-based AI, virtual patient simulation, and _in silico_ evidence generation to help you build, test, and validate digital modalities before they ever reach a patient.

We bring the precision of preclinical research into digital health—de-risking development, supporting regulatory alignment, and accelerating time-to-market for DTx, digital biomarkers, and digital endpoints.



_In silico_ modeling and model-based AI bridge preclinical research rigor to advance digital therapeutics, biomarkers, and clinical measures.

We create scientifically grounded, interpretable AI algorithms to reduce development risks, support regulatory compliance, and accelerate market entry for evidence-based digital solutions—including remote monitoring and closed-loop drug-device innovations.


We specialize in guiding breakthroughs in Digital Therapeutics (DTx) innovation, including drug-device combinations (‘smart medications’), through a Systems Medicine approach. -->
